### Further progress:
1. Unifies units of emissions to parts per million(ppm) across all pollutants. 
2. Create a visualisation that shows the distribution of emissions during 24 hours. It gives us a general idea of at what time a pollutant is more common in the air, and it helps us identify whether there is a relationship between hours and emission level.

3. Create a further visualisation that selects 5 top hours that have the most emissions during the 24 hours and combines the four pollutants into one graph. From the graph, it shows that there are fewer pollutants in the afternoon than in the morning. Overall, 7am and 8am are the most serious time periods.

### Preliminary conclusions:
1. The emission level from highest to lowest is CO, O3, NO2, SO2, 
2. From 2010 to 2016, decreased pollutants are NO2, SO2, CO. O3 stays the same. 
3. Based on our first ML analysis, the data is more accurately classified when there are just two labels (urban and rural) compared to three (urban, rural, and suburban). Also, it tells us that urban and rural areas have much more air pollution difference. 
4. Based on our latest visualisation, we found that air pollution is more serious in the morning than in the afternoon. 
5. Based on our dataset, we found that there are a lot of data points that has AQI Index larger than 50, which is into the second category - "moderate"("Moderate" AQI is 51 to 100. Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people. For example, people who are unusually sensitive to ozone may experience respiratory symptoms). A more detailed explanation of catergarization of AQI is listed at the end. Accordinly, we know that U.S. has a air pollution problem. 

### Interesting Issues:
1. We tried to use the SVM to classify land use based on the daily average emission level of each pollutant. The result is not that satisfactory. 

### Interesting facts

#### Recommended exposure limit of each pollutant:
	- CO: TWA 35 ppm (40 mg/m3) C 200 ppm (229 mg/m3)
	- O3: C 0.1 ppm (0.2 mg/m3)
	- NO2: ST 1 ppm (1.8 mg/m3
	- SO2: TWA 2 ppm (5 mg/m3) ST 5 ppm (13 mg/m3)

#### Permissible exposure limit of each pollutant:
	- CO: TWA 50 ppm (55 mg/m3)
	- O3: TWA 0.1 ppm (0.2 mg/m3)
	- NO2: C 5 ppm (9 mg/m3
	- SO2: TWA 5 ppm (13 mg/m3)

#### Immediately dangerous to life or health
	- CO: < 1200 ppm
	- O3: < 5 ppm
	- NO2: < 20 ppm 
	- SO2: < 100 ppm

#### Air Quality Index (AQI): to help explain air pollution levels to the general public.

Here are the categorization:
	![AQI Index](/images/Max_Hour_day.png)

1. "Good" AQI is 0 to 50. Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.
2. "Moderate" AQI is 51 to 100. Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people. For example, people who are unusually sensitive to ozone may experience respiratory symptoms.
3. "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" AQI is 101 to 150. Although general public is not likely to be affected at this AQI range, people with lung disease, older adults and children are at a greater risk from exposure to ozone, whereas persons with heart and lung disease, older adults and children are at greater risk from the presence of particles in the air.
4. "Unhealthy" AQI is 151 to 200. Everyone may begin to experience some adverse health effects, and members of the sensitive groups may experience more serious effects.
5. "Very Unhealthy" AQI is 201 to 300. This would trigger a health alert signifying that everyone may experience more serious health effects.
6. "Hazardous" AQI greater than 300. This would trigger a health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected.
