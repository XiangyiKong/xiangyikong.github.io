In this set of posts you should document your further progress.  Include any interesting issues or preliminary conclusions you have about your data.

Further progress:
1. Unifies data units of emissions across all pollutants. 
2. Create visualisations on dimension [maxHour, emission level]


Preliminary conclusions:
1. The emission level from highest to lowest is CO, O3, NO2, SO2, 
2. From 2010 to 2016, decreased pollutants are NO2, SO2, CO. O3 stays the same. 
3. Top states for CO: puerto rico
4. Top states for O3: colorado
5. Top states for NO2: hawaii
6. Top states for SO2: puerto rico

7. Has each pollutant exceeded the unhealthy level?

Interesting Issues:





Facts about NO2, CO, O3, SO2:
1. Air Quality Index (AQI): to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. Under the current standards, eight-hour average ozone mole fractions of 85 to 104 nmol/mol are described as "unhealthy for sensitive groups", 105 nmol/mol to 124 nmol/mol as "unhealthy", and 125 nmol/mol to 404 nmol/mol as "very unhealthy".
