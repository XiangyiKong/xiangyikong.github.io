### Further progress:
1. Unifies units of emissions to parts per million(ppm) across all pollutants. 
2. Create a visualisation that shows how emissions are distributed in 24 hours. It gives us a general idea of at what time the pollutant is more common in the air every day, and it helps us identify whether there is a relationship between hours and emission level.

3. Create a further visualisation that combines the four pollutants into one graph and shows 5 top hours of each that have the most emissions during the 24 hours. From the graph, it shows that there are fewer pollutants in the afternoon than in the morning. Overall, 7am and 8am are the most serious time period.

### Preliminary conclusions:
1. The emission level from highest to lowest is CO, O3, NO2, SO2, 
2. From 2010 to 2016, decreased pollutants are NO2, SO2, CO. O3 stays the same. 
3. Based on our first ML analysis, the data is more accurately classified when there are just two labels (urban and rural) compared to three (urban, rural, and suburban).

### Interesting facts

#### Recommended exposure limit of each pollutant:
	- CO: TWA 35 ppm (40 mg/m3) C 200 ppm (229 mg/m3)
	- O3: C 0.1 ppm (0.2 mg/m3)
	- NO2: ST 1 ppm (1.8 mg/m3
	- SO2: TWA 2 ppm (5 mg/m3) ST 5 ppm (13 mg/m3)

#### Permissible exposure limit of each pollutant:
	- CO: TWA 50 ppm (55 mg/m3)
	- O3: TWA 0.1 ppm (0.2 mg/m3)
	- NO2: C 5 ppm (9 mg/m3
	- SO2: TWA 5 ppm (13 mg/m3)

#### Immediately dangerous to life or health
	- CO: < 1200 ppm
	- O3: < 5 ppm
	- NO2: < 20 ppm 
	- SO2: < 100 ppm

#### Air Quality Index (AQI): to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. Under the current standards, eight-hour average ozone mole fractions of 85 to 104 nmol/mol are described as "unhealthy for sensitive groups", 105 nmol/mol to 124 nmol/mol as "unhealthy", and 125 nmol/mol to 404 nmol/mol as "very unhealthy".
