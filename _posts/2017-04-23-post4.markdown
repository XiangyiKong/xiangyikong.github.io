## New machine learning analyses:



#### SVM using weather data to predict pollution emission levels



_Data preparation_

We first sought to perform binary classification by training an SVM with weather data to predict whether the pollution level was "good" or "bad" on a particular day in a particular location. To do so, we had to decide how to binarize the data points into "good" and "bad" emission levels. For this first analysis, we split the data points in half by finding its median air quality index (AQI) for one pollutant and treating all data points with an AQI above the median as "bad" and those with an AQI below the median as "good".

For training features, we used four variables related to weather: average wind speed, average temperature, average humidity, and average barometric pressure.

_SVM results_

We performed this SVM analylsis in four conditions: one using each pollutant as the AQI label.

* CO: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 55.30%
* NO2: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 52.36%
* O3: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 71.98%
* SO2: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 49.85%

_Interpretation of results_

This initial analysis showed us that the AQI relating to O3 may be the best indicator for pollution level. When we used the other pollutants as the label-decider, we yielded about chance performance.

#### SVM using weather and location data to predict pollution emission levels



_Data preparation_

In this analysis, we included the weather data from the first SVM along with the location information of the pollution site. In this instance, we had seven variables as our training features: average wind speed, average temperature, average humidity, average barometric pressure, location setting (urban, suburban, or rural), land use, and elevation.

_SVM results_

We found similar results when these location data were included. O3 remained the best indicator for labeling the data as "good" or "bad" pollution levels.

* CO: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 53.17%
* NO2: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 55.56%
* O3: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 72.50%
* SO2: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 50.41%

_Interpretation of results_

#### SVM using weather data to predict significantly different pollution emission levels

_Data preparation_

Since the first two classifiers achieved only moderately good results, we wanted a way to separate our data more clearly into data points that represented starkly different pollution emission levels. We sought to explore how well a classifier trained on features relating to weather could discern between days of "really low" and "really high" pollution. To do so, we treated any data point with an AQI less than 1/2 standard deviation below the mean as "really low" and any data point with an AQI greater than 1/2 standard deviation above the mean as "really high". Though this cut out a large fraction of the data, we saw it as a viable way to binarize our data more cleanly. The training features were the same as the first SVM described above: average wind speed, average temperature, average humidity, and average barometric pressure.

_SVM results_

* CO: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 61.81%
* NO2: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 70.71%
* O3: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 85.77%
* SO2: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 67.46%

_Interpretation of results_

Unsurprisingly, spliting the data in this manner raised the accuracy of the classifier for each pollutant.

Since using O3 generated such a different accuracy result, we plotted the distributions of AQIs for each pollutant as histograms:

![aqi hist](/images/o3_aqi_hist.png)

![aqi hist](/images/no2_aqi_hist.png)

![aqi hist](/images/so2_aqi_hist.png)

![aqi hist](/images/co_aqi_hist.png)

The advantage of this model is that it gives us a finer grained classification because U.S. tends to have a better air quality in the world, and by artificially choosing the median value as a threshold for AQI, it will give us a better test result towards the U.S.. 

The disadvantage of this model is that the training model depends more on our current data sets, aka the current environment situation in the U.S., so it is hard to generalize to other countries in the world. We are wondering if choosing a training model that use AQI = 50 as a threshold works(According to EPA, AQI above 50, air quality is bad.).

Moreover, from the four histograms, we know that the ratio of AQI > 50 to the total number of AQIs is pretty low for each pollutant. Especially for CO, the ratio is around 2 %. Accordingly, it is hard to get a good training result from this unbalanced data sets since the training model tends to classify each record to an AQI less than 50. To solve this problem, we decide to use oversampling/undersampling method, which can adjust the class distribution of a data set. 

Also, we tried several different classification models, such as logistic regression, navie bayes, etc. After multiple experiments, the results showed that logistic regression has the highest accuracy.

_Logistic Regression results_

* CO: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 93.54%, std:0.027
* NO2: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 82.35%, std: 0.039
* O3: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 85.77%, std: 0.030
* SO2: 10-fold cross validation accuracy: 80.25%, std: 0.022


## Future directions and plans for final demo

* In the next two weeks, we plan to further investigate the relation between time series and pollutants' emission levels as well as find out better feature extraction for the classification.

* For the application demo, we wish to create an interactive prediction web page where user can input weather conditions, locations and future time, and our model will give a predicted air quality.
