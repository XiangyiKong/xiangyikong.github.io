The second week has been going well ! I experienced some difficulties when setting up the tools for the project 1, but 
TA offered me timely help while I was feeling hopeless. Piazza is also a supplemental aid to finding answers to problems or 
questions from either classes or the project one, which clearifies a lot confusion about the project 1 as well. 
The class continuously maintains a clear structure. The repetition of the class contents deepens my understandings. 
Due to preparation for my GRE test on Saturday, I haven't keeping up with 
the readings in class, which negatively influences my quiz grades. For next week, without the interruption from the test, it 
is necessary to finish the required materials in advance.  
I am looking forward for the next week to start. I feel like the class can offer me unbounded knowledge from the projects.
